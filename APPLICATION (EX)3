a user is asked to input their ATM PIN, and the loop continues to request the PIN until the correct one is entered.
Since the user has to enter the PIN at least once, this is a good use case for the do-while loop [ATM PIN Validation]


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

int correct_pin = 1234; // Assume the correct PIN is 1234

int entered_pin;

// Using do-while loop to keep asking for the PIN until the correct one is entered

do {

printf("Please enter your 4-digit ATM PIN: ");

scanf("%d", &entered_pin);

if (entered_pin != correct_pin) { // != not equal

printf("Incorrect PIN. Try again.\n");

}

} while (entered_pin != correct_pin);

printf("PIN accepted. Access granted.\n");

return 0;

}
