Print even numbers from 2 to 10

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

// Loop starts with i = 2 and increments by 2 each time (for even numbers)

for (int i = 2; i <= 10; i += 2) {

// Prints the current value of 'i' (which will be an even number)

printf("%d\n", i);

}

return 0; // End of the program

}
