In C programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code as long
as a specified condition is true. C provides three primary types of
loops:

for loop

while loop

do-while loop
///////////////////

The for loop is typically used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists
of three components: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement, all in a single line.

Ex.: Counting from 1 to 5

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {

printf("%d\n", i);

}

return 0;

}
